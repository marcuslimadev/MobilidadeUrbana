Flutter Update Process

For the Flutter update, please note that it requires a full reconfiguration /reinstallation to properly adapt to the new changes. Since the entire mobile app—including all Flutter components—is rebuilt from the ground up, any modifications to the app's core code will necessitate a complete reconfiguration or fresh installation of the app on the device.
